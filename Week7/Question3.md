# Code Explanation

This document provides a detailed explanation of the Python script which consists of two files: `book.py` and `main.py`. The explanations are aimed at students who are not familiar with programming.

## `book.py`

This file defines a `Book` class, which is a blueprint for creating `Book` objects. Each `Book` object can store information about a book's title, author, and publication year. Here is the code and the detailed explanation of each part:

```python
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author, publication_year):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.publication_year = publication_year
```

Explanation:
- `class Book:` defines a new class named `Book`.
- `def __init__(self, title, author, publication_year):` defines the constructor method that is called when a new `Book` object is created. It takes three parameters: title, author, and publication year.
- The lines inside the constructor method assign the values passed as parameters to the object's attributes: `self.title`, `self.author`, and `self.publication_year`.

```python
    def __str__(self):
        return "{} by {}, published in {}".format(self.title, self.author, self.publication_year)
```

Explanation:
- `def __str__(self):` defines a method that returns a string representation of a `Book` object.
- The `return` statement uses the `format` method to create a string that displays the book's details in a readable format.

```python
    def __eq__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, Book):
            return (self.title == other.title and self.author == other.author 
                    and self.publication_year == other.publication_year)
        return False
```

Explanation:
- `def __eq__(self, other):` defines a method to compare two `Book` objects to see if they are equal, based on their attributes.
- `if isinstance(other, Book):` checks if the `other` object is an instance of the `Book` class.
- The `return` statement inside the `if` block returns `True` if all the attributes of the two `Book` objects are equal, and `False` otherwise.

## `main.py`

This file contains the main script which uses the `Book` class to create book objects and perform file operations. Here is the code along with the detailed explanation:

```python
from book import Book
```

Explanation:
- This line imports the `Book` class from the `book.py` file, so that we can use it in this script.

```python
def write_file(lst, file_path):
    with open(file_path, "w") as file:
        for book in lst:
            file.write("{}| {}| {}\n".format(book.title, 
                                                book.author, 
                                                book.publication_year))
```

Explanation:
- `def write_file(lst, file_path):` defines a function named `write_file` that takes two parameters: a list of `Book` objects (`lst`) and a file path (`file_path`).
- `with open(file_path, "w") as file:` opens the file in write mode ('w'). If the file does not exist, it will be created. The `with` statement ensures that the file is closed properly at the end of the block.
- The `for` loop iterates over each `book` object in the list `lst`.
- Inside the loop, `file.write(...)` writes the details of each book (title, author, and publication year) to the file, separated by the pipe ('|') character. The '\n' at the end writes a newline character, so each book's details are written on a new line.

```python
def read_file(lst, file_path):
    with open(file_path, "r") as file:
        for line in file:
            line = line.strip()
            values = line.split("|")
            title = values[0].strip()
            author = values[1].strip()
            publication_year = int(values[2].strip())
            lst.append(Book(title, author, publication_year))
```

Explanation:
- `def read_file(lst, file_path):` defines a function named `read_file` that takes a list (`lst`) and a file path (`file_path`) as parameters.
- `with open(file_path, "r") as file:` opens the file in read mode ('r').
- The `for` loop iterates over each line in the file.
- `line = line.strip()` removes any leading and trailing whitespace from the line.
- `values = line.split("|")` splits the line into a list of values using the pipe ('|') character as the delimiter.
- `title = values[0].strip()`, `author = values[1].strip()`, and `publication_year = int(values[2].strip())` extract the title, author, and publication year from the list of values, and remove any leading and trailing whitespace from the title and author. The `int(...)` function converts the publication year to an integer.
- `lst.append(Book(title, author, publication_year))` creates a new `Book` object with the extracted values and adds it to the list `lst`.

The following part of the `main.py` file reads data from a "books.txt" file, creates several new `Book` objects, adds them to a list, and then writes this updated list to a new "books2.txt" file. This segment of the code will be explained in the next update of this document.

```python
# Read the books file
file_name = "books.txt"
file_name1 = "books2.txt"
book_list = []
read_file(book_list, file_name)

book6 = Book("Brave New World", "Aldous Huxley", 1932)
book7 = Book("The Lord of the Rings", "J.R.R. Tolkien", 1954)
book8 = Book("The Alchemist", "Paulo Coelho", 1988)
book9 = Book("The Chronicles of Narnia", "C.S. Lewis", 1950)
book10 = Book("Crime and Punishment", "Fyodor Dostoevsky", 1866)

book_list.append(book6)
book_list.append(book7)
book_list.append(book8)
book_list.append(book9)
book_list.append(book10)

# Write all the book in the book_list
write_file(book_list, file_name1)
```

Explanation:
- `file_name = "books.txt"` and `file_name1 = "books2.txt"`: These lines define two variables to hold the names of the files we will be reading from and writing to.
- `book_list = []`: This line creates an empty list named `book_list` which will be used to store `Book` objects.
- `read_file(book_list, file_name)`: This line calls the `read_file` function to read the book details from the "books.txt" file and populate the `book_list` with `Book` objects.
- The next set of lines creates five new `Book` objects with hardcoded values for the title, author, and publication year.
- `book_list.append(book6)`, `book_list.append(book7)`, etc.: These lines add the newly created `Book` objects to the `book_list`.
- `write_file(book_list, file_name1)`: This line calls the `write_file` function to write all the book details in the `book_list` to the "books2.txt" file.
