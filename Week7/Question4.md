# Detailed Explanation of the matrix_mul Function

This Python function called `matrix_mul` performs matrix multiplication. The function takes two matrices, A and B, as inputs and returns a new matrix, C, which contains the result of the multiplication.


```python
def matrix_mul(A, B):
    columns_a = len(A[0])
    rows_a = len(A)
    columns_b = len(B[0])
    rows_b = len(B)
```

Explanation:
- `def matrix_mul(A, B):` defines a new function named `matrix_mul` that takes two parameters, A and B, which are the matrices to be multiplied.
- `columns_a = len(A[0])` and `rows_a = len(A)` calculate the number of columns and rows in matrix A, respectively.
- `columns_b = len(B[0])` and `rows_b = len(B)` calculate the number of columns and rows in matrix B, respectively.

```python
    if columns_a != rows_b:
        return None
```

Explanation:
- This segment checks if the number of columns in matrix A is not equal to the number of rows in matrix B. If this condition is true, it means the matrices are not conformable for multiplication, and the function returns `None`.

```python
    C= []
    for i in range(rows_a):
        C.append([0] * columns_b)
    print(C)
```

Explanation:
- `C= []` initializes an empty list which will be used to store the result of the matrix multiplication.
- The `for` loop that follows initializes matrix C with zero values. It has the same number of rows as matrix A and the same number of columns as matrix B.
- `print(C)` is just printing the initialized matrix C to the console. This line can be removed in the final version of the function.

```python
    for i in range(rows_a):
        for j in range(columns_b):
            for k in range(rows_b):
                C[i][j] = C[i][j] + A[i][k] * B[k][j]
    return C
```

Explanation:
- These lines implement the matrix multiplication algorithm using three nested loops to calculate each element in the resultant matrix C.
- `C[i][j] = C[i][j] + A[i][k] * B[k][j]` computes each element in matrix C as the sum of the products of the corresponding elements from matrices A and B.

```python
A = [[1, 2, 5],
     [2, 2, 6],
     [7, 2, 5]]
B = [[5, 1, 6],
     [6, 6, 7],
     [2, 2, 1]]
result = matrix_mul(A, B)
if result:
    for row in result:
        print(row)
```

Explanation:
- Here, two matrices A and B are defined.
- `result = matrix_mul(A, B)` calls the `matrix_mul` function with A and B as arguments and stores the result in the `result` variable.
- If the result is not `None` (meaning the multiplication was successful), it iterates over each row in the result and prints it to the console.
