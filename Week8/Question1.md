### **Step 1: Setting Up the Input Loop**
First, you need to set up a loop that will ask the user to enter a word continuously. You'll store each word in a list. The loop will keep running until the user inputs the letter `"n"`.

- Create an empty list to store the words.
- Use a `while True` loop to repeatedly prompt the user to enter a word.
- Add each entered word to the list.
- Check if the user enters `"n"`. If they do, stop the loop.

**Example Code:**

```python
words = []  # Create an empty list to store words

while True:
    word = input("Enter a word: ")  # Prompt the user to enter a word
    
    if word == 'n':  # Check if the user entered "n"
        break  # Exit the loop if "n" is entered
    
    words.append(word)  # Add the word to the list
```

### **Step 2: Creating the `generate_sentence(lst)` Function**
Now that we have the list of words, we need to turn them into a sentence.

- Define a function named `generate_sentence(lst)` that takes a list of words as input.
- Use Python’s built-in `join` method to combine the words into a single string (sentence).
- The `join` method will add spaces between the words to create the sentence.

**Example Code:**

```python
def generate_sentence(lst):
    return " ".join(lst)  # Use the join method to combine words with spaces
```

### **Step 3: Calling the Function to Generate the Sentence**
Once the user has entered all their words and the loop ends, we need to call the `generate_sentence(lst)` function to create the sentence. We will then print the sentence.

- After the loop, check if the list of words is not empty.
- Call the `generate_sentence(lst)` function with the list of words as an argument.
- Print the returned sentence.

**Example Code:**

```python
if words:  # Check if the list is not empty
    sentence = generate_sentence(words)  # Call the function and pass the list
    print(sentence)  # Print the generated sentence
```

### **Step 4: Putting It All Together**
Now, combine all the steps into a complete Python program. Here’s what the final structure should look like:

```python
words = []  # Create an empty list to store words

while True:
    word = input("Enter a word: ")  # Prompt the user to enter a word
    
    if word == 'n':  # Check if the user entered "n"
        break  # Exit the loop if "n" is entered
    
    words.append(word)  # Add the word to the list

def generate_sentence(lst):
    return " ".join(lst)  # Use the join method to combine words with spaces

if words:  # Check if the list is not empty
    sentence = generate_sentence(words)  # Call the function and pass the list
    print(sentence)  # Print the generated sentence
```

### **Sample Output:**
Here’s an example of what your program should look like when it runs:

```
Enter a word: A
Do you want to continue, enter 'n' to exit:
Enter a word: quick
Do you want to continue, enter 'n' to exit:
Enter a word: brown
Do you want to continue, enter 'n' to exit:
Enter a word: fox
Do you want to continue, enter 'n' to exit:
Enter a word: n
A quick brown fox
```

### **Notes:**
- **Important**: Always test your code with different inputs to make sure it works as expected.
- The `join` method is a simple yet powerful tool in Python. Practice using it with different separators, such as commas, hyphens, or even new lines.
