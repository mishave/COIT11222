## Part C: Written/Explain Type Questions

### 1. Essential Components of a Computer:
A computer typically consists of:
- **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**: The brain of the computer where most calculations take place.
- **Memory (RAM)**: Temporary storage used to store data that the CPU may need quickly.
- **Storage (Hard Drive, SSD)**: Permanent storage for data and software.
- **Input Devices**: Such as keyboard and mouse.
- **Output Devices**: Such as monitors and printers.
- **Motherboard**: A board that connects and allows communication between different computer components.
- **Power Supply Unit**: Provides power to the computer.

### 2. Function of Central Processing Unit (CPU):
The CPU is responsible for executing instructions of a computer program. It performs basic arithmetic, logical, control, and input/output operations.

### 3. Function of Main Memory:
Main memory (RAM) provides the space for the computer to read and write data to be accessed by the CPU quickly. Programs and data that are being actively used are stored here because it's faster than secondary storage (like HDDs or SSDs).

### 4. What is a Program?
A program is a set of instructions written in a programming language that tells a computer how to perform a specific task.

### 5. Input and Type Converter Functions in Python:
Input functions, like `input()`, are used to get data from users. Type converter functions, like `int()`, `float()`, and `str()`, convert data types. They are essential for data processing because they ensure data is in the right format for operations.

### 6. Debugger:
A debugger is a tool used to test and debug a program. Programmers use it to identify and fix errors or "bugs" in their code.

### 7. Special Class Methods in Python:
Special methods (often called "magic methods") in Python classes allow customization of default behaviors for built-in operations. For instance:
- `__str__()`: Returns a user-friendly string representation of the object.
- `__eq__()`: Allows custom behavior for the equality (`==`) operator.
- `__lt__()`: Used for the "less than" (`<`) comparison.
- `__gt__()`: Used for the "greater than" (`>`) comparison.

### 8. Descriptive Vocabulary in Programming:
High-level programming languages like Python, BASIC, and COBOL use easily understood vocabulary with descriptive terms.

### 9. Translator for High-level Language to Machine Code:
The software that translates high-level language statements into machine code all at once and generates an executable file is called a **Compiler**.

### 10. Source Code:
Source code is the set of human-readable instructions written in a programming language that describes how a program should function.

### 11. Code Compilation and Correctness:
Just because code compiles and produces an output doesn't mean it's correct. It may still have logical errors or not meet the specified requirements.

### 12. Comments in Code:
Comments provide explanations or annotations in the code for better understanding. They are ignored by the compiler or interpreter and are not executed.

### 13. Mutable vs Immutable Data Types:
Mutable data types can be changed after they are created, while immutable data types cannot. Examples:
- Immutable: `str`, `tuple`
- Mutable: `list`
