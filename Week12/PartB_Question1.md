## Point Class Implementation:

First, we'll implement the `Point` class as described in the question.

```python
import math

class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def distance(self, other):
        return math.sqrt((self.x - other.x)**2 + (self.y - other.y)**2)

    def reflect_x(self):
        return Point(self.x, -self.y)

    def slope_from_origin(self):
        if self.x == 0:
            return float('inf')  # Slope is undefined for vertical lines.
        return self.y / self.x

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.x == other.x and self.y == other.y

    def __str__(self):
        return f"({self.x}, {self.y})"
```

### a) Create a list of five points:

```python
points = [Point(0, 1), Point(1, 3), Point(2, 5), Point(3, 7), Point(4, 9)]
```

### b) Display coordinates using a for loop:

```python
for point in points:
    print(str(point))
```

This will print the coordinates of each point in the list.

### c) Determine `slope_from_origin` for the second point:

```python
slope = points[1].slope_from_origin()
print(f"Slope from origin for the second point: {slope}")
```

### d) Determine distance between the first and last points:

```python
distance = points[0].distance(points[-1])
print(f"Distance between the first and last points: {distance:.2f}")
```
