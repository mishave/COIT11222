### Question 2

**(a) Output of the Given Code:**

Given `x = -6`, let's evaluate the conditions:

1. \(x \geq 0 \) and \(x \% 3 \neq 0\): This is `False` because -6 is not greater than or equal to 0.
2. \(x > 0\) and \(x \% 3 \neq 0\): This is `False` because -6 is not greater than 0.

Since both conditions are `False`, the code will execute the `else` block. 

Output: 
```
x is not a multiple of 3
```

**(b) Error in the Program:**

Yes, there's a logical error. The second condition checks if `x > 0` (positive) but then states "x is a negative and a multiple of 3", which is contradictory. 

To fix the error, the conditions should be re-evaluated and the print statements corrected to match the conditions. One potential solution is:

```python
if x > 0 and x % 3 == 0:
    print("x is positive and a multiple of 3")
elif x < 0 and x % 3 == 0:
    print("x is negative and a multiple of 3")
else:
    print("x is not a multiple of 3")
```

**(c) Output of the Given Code:**

The function `function(lst)` reverses the order of elements in the list `lst`. 

Given `names = ["2023 ", "exam ", "Sample", "COIT11222"]`, after calling `function(names)`, the list becomes `["COIT11222", "Sample", "exam ", "2023 "]`.

The while loop prints each element of the reversed list along with its index:

Output:
```
Count: 0
COIT11222 
Count: 1
Sample 
Count: 2
exam  
Count: 3
2023  
```
